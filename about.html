        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Lee Meneres is a multidisciplinary artist, musician, and producer based in Lisbon. Her work moves fluidly between music, performance, and visual experimentation — an ongoing exploration of sound as emotion, texture, and space.</p>

<p>As a co-founder, guitarist, and producer of As Docinhas, Lee builds worlds that blur the lines between concert and performance. The project thrives on collaboration and invention, weaving music, theatre, and visual language into immersive live experiences that balance playfulness and precision.</p>

<p>Alongside the band, Lee develops her solo project Leexo, where she dives into electronic production, songwriting, and visual storytelling. Through Leexo, she crafts introspective soundscapes that blend organic and digital elements — an intimate reflection of memory, rhythm, and transformation.</p>

    </p>With formal training in music technology and live event production, Lee also works behind the scenes as a light and video technician, bringing the same sense of detail and emotion to her technical practice.</p>
